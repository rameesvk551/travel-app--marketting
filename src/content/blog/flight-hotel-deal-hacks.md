# How to Find the Best Flight and Hotel Deals

Every traveler wants the same thing: the best experience for the least money. Here's how the savviest travelers find deals that others miss.

## Flight Deal Strategies

### 1. Be Flexible with Dates
Flying on Tuesday or Wednesday is typically 20-30% cheaper than weekend flights. Use fare calendars to find the cheapest days in your travel window.

### 2. Book at the Right Time
- **Domestic flights**: 3-6 weeks before departure
- **International flights**: 2-3 months before departure
- **Peak season**: Book 4-6 months ahead

### 3. Use Fare Alerts
Set up price alerts for your route. Flight prices fluctuate by 10-40% over a single week. An alert catches the dips you'd otherwise miss.

### 4. Consider Alternative Airports
Flying into a nearby city and taking a short train or bus can save significantly. Delhi to Chandigarh instead of Delhi to Shimla, for example.

### 5. Check Multi-City Options
Sometimes A→B→C is cheaper than A→B and B→C booked separately.

## Hotel Deal Strategies

### 1. Compare Across Platforms
The same hotel room can vary by 30% across different booking platforms. Always compare at least 3 sites.

### 2. Book Direct (Sometimes)
Hotels often offer loyalty points, free breakfast, or free cancellation when you book directly through their website.

### 3. Consider Alternative Accommodation
Hostels, homestays, and serviced apartments can offer better value than hotels, especially for longer stays or groups.

### 4. Travel Off-Peak
Hotel prices in tourist destinations can drop by 40-60% outside peak season. Shoulder season (just before or after peak) often offers the best balance of weather and price.

### 5. Use Bundle Deals
Flight + hotel bundles can save 15-25% compared to booking separately.

## The Aggregation Advantage

Modern platforms like Wayon aggregate deals across 20+ booking platforms, showing you the cheapest option for every search. No need to open 10 tabs — see all prices in one view with transparent fee comparison.

### What to Watch Out For
- Hidden resort fees
- Non-refundable vs flexible rate differences
- Baggage fees on budget airlines
- Dynamic pricing during high-demand periods

## Pro Tips

1. **Clear your cookies** before searching (or use incognito mode)
2. **Set a budget ceiling** before you start looking
3. **If it's a good deal, book it** — analysis paralysis costs money
4. **Subscribe to deal newsletters** for flash sales
